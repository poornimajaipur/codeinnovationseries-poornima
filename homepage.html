                <h3>War in the Time of Neanderthals: How Our Species Battled for Supremacy for Over 100,000 Years</h3>

                <p>Around 600,000 years ago, humanity split in two. One group stayed in Africa, evolving into us. The
                    other struck out overland, into Asia, then Europe, becoming Homo neanderthalensis – the
                    Neanderthals. They weren’t our ancestors, but a sister species, evolving in parallel. </p>

                <h3>Indian police use violence as a shortcut to justice. It's the poorest who bear the scars</h3>

                <p>Bengaluru, India (CNN)It was minutes into India's Independence Day when police stormed a slum in the
                    western state of Gujarat where Hira Bajania, 65, was sleeping. In the black of night, he was dragged
                    from his home, taken to a nearby police station and accused, with 11 other men, of stealing cell
                    phones. </p>

                <h3>How Non-English Speakers Learn This Crazy Grammar Rule You Know But Never Heard Of</h3>

                <p>English grammar, beloved by sticklers, is also feared by non-native speakers. Many of its
                    idiosyncrasies can turn into traps even for the most confident users.But some of the most binding
                    rules in English are things that native speakers know but don’t know they know. </p>

                <h3>Five Smart Ways to Fight Food Waste</h3>

                <p>We humans have a puzzling attitude towards food — it’s one of the few things in life that we
                    absolutely need to survive, yet we can be shockingly careless with it. From a shriveled up peach
                    that went ignored in a fridge drawer to a misshapen cabbage tossed for not meeting supermarket
                    standards, 1.3 billion tons of food is discarded each year. </p>

                <h3>Best Playstation 5 games: From Demon's Souls to Horizon Forbidden West</h3>

                <p>The Playstation 5 is here. It’s a big mammoth white thing that looks half futuristic, half like a
                    set-top TV recorder. It’s very easy to be snarky about new console names and designs – remember when
                    everyone laughed at the Wii?– but I, for one, am extremely excited to get my hands on a brand-new
                    console with some truly impressive specs and features. </p>

                <h3>What Everyone Can Learn from Introverts</h3>

                <p>“People have stereotypes of introverts being lone wolves, passive in contributing, even anti-social.
                    But the fact is, introverts are oftentimes the ones who get things done without asking for credit,
                    find solutions for their teammates, and are willing to do the work that nobody else wants to do or
                    didn't even pay attention to.” </p>

                <h3>10 Works of Literary Fantasy You Should Read</h3>

                <p>Today marks the release of one of the most anticipated books of 2019: Marlon James’s Black Leopard,
                    Red Wolf, a sprawling literary fantasy and the first in a projected series. James is one of our best
                    and most interesting contemporary writers, and I suggest that you read his latest—as well as any
                    number of other works of literary fantasy, some of which I will recommend below. </p>

                <h3>The Hardest Part About Learning Hard Things</h3>

                <p> I’ve been recording a lot of podcast interviews for my book, Ultralearning. One of the recurring
                    themes I’ve noticed in our conversations is that how people feel about learning is the overwhelming
                    cause of the results they experience.

                    Yes intelligence, talent, great teachers and schools all matter. </p>

                <h3>Why Black Hole Interiors Grow (Almost) Forever</h3>

                <p> Leonard Susskind, a pioneer of string theory, the holographic principle and other big physics ideas
                    spanning the past half-century, has proposed a solution to an important puzzle about black holes.
                    The problem is that even though these mysterious, invisible spheres appear to stay a constant size
                    as viewed from the outside, their interiors keep growing in volume essentially forever. How is this
                    possible? </p>
